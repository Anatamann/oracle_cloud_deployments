# Project Summary

## Iteration - 1 

Created the initial planning document for the project: `PLANNING.md`. This document outlines the project goal, features, file structure, and next steps for creating a simple web page with a video background.

## Iteration - 2

Created the basic structure of the web page: `index.html`, `style.css`, and the `video` directory. The page is ready for local testing, pending the addition of a video file.

## Iteration - 3

Updated `style.css` to create a text masking effect on the 'Hello World' heading. The background video will now be visible through the text.

## Iteration - 4

Corrected the CSS for the text masking effect. The new implementation uses a different `mix-blend-mode` approach to ensure the video is correctly displayed through the text.

## Iteration - 5

Finally corrected the CSS for the text masking effect. The `mix-blend-mode` is now correctly applied to the text elements, which should result in the desired video-in-text effect.

## Iteration - 6

Added a `text-shadow` to the `h1` and `p` elements to create a drop shadow effect. This is intended to improve text readability against the video background.
